# Minimal, Educational NeRF (Scaffold)

## What NeRF is
TODO: Write 2–3 paragraphs explaining NeRF and radiance fields.

## Pipeline: rays → points → colors
TODO: Briefly describe how rays are generated, points sampled, MLP predicted (rgb, sigma), and volume rendering composed.

## What works
TODO: List what you implemented and tested.

## What is missing
TODO: List missing features and planned TODOs (e.g., hierarchical sampling, view directions).

## What confused you
TODO: Record unclear parts to revisit after rereading the paper.

## Run instructions (CPU)
TODO: Add simple steps to run training on CPU, dataset assumptions, and expected output.
